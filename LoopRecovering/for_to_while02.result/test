Select some options to deal with the C Language:
Parse as C:
Prettyprint the source as C, of course
Do not display original number lines as comment:
If possible, transform simple for-loops into do-loop à la Fortran, simpler to analyze:
Desugaring other for-loops into plain while-loops fot the time we improve semantics ameliorations in PIPS:
Select the most precise analysis:
Compute the intraprocedural preconditions at the same time as
transformers and use them to improve the accuracy of expression
and statement transformers:
Try to restructure the code for more precision:
Privatize scalar variables on all the modules of the program:
Ask for some statistics about the job to be done:
Ask for the parallelization of all the modules of the program with OpenMP output:
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
   // BEGIN BLOCK

   int l, m, a;

#pragma omp parallel for private(a,m)
   for(l = 0; l <= 63; l += 1) {
      // BEGIN BLOCK
      /* Since this for loop is desugared in a while() with an
             initialization before, it is a sequence, thus the label which
             cannor be associated on a sequence is put on a ";" inside the
             sequence and this is the ";" which is outlined instead of the
             for-loop... */
