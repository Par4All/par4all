Unlike Semantics, the tpips scripts use the current pipsmake
environment (Fall 2009) and not the initial one.

anywhere01: *p = ... impact of anywhere effects with different options
            (see pointer01, 02, 03, 04 for interprocedural issues)

anywhere02:

atoll:      call site located in a declaration initialization (P. Villalon)

global01.c: take abstract locations into account (derived from
	    Benchmarks/whetstone, submitted by Serge Guelton)

gonnord_thesis_x_y.c: example found in PhD dissertation Chapter x, Example y

gopan3.c:   example from Gopan (preparation of a paper, bug fix 
            for loop postcondition)

gulwani03.c: example from Gulwani (same as opan3)

gulvani_xxx.c: Vivien Maisonneuve (one control node)

linked_regions02.c: a bug with regions linked to the way transformers
                    and preconditions are computed. I fixed a bug in
                    declaration_to_transformer (use a range instead of
                    a precondition) and the region computation
                    generated lots of overflows and, worse, return a
                    wrong result for the loop regions

linked_regions03.c: same as linked_regions02, but with additional ifs
                    to obtain intermediate results; also check of the transformer
                    computation for multiplication when the arguments are positive and
                    have upper bounds

linked_regions04.c: same as linked_region03.c, but the loops are
                    distributed to integrate/sum the array references
                    one by one before computing the convex hull. No
                    overflow, much faster, correct result for the
                    convex array regions.

             Test cases developped in 2010-2011 by Vivien or Francois
             to expose weaknesses in semantics, especially in the
             transitive closure

pc01-04:     Different encoding of a program counter. The goal is to 
             show robustness wrt the encoding
