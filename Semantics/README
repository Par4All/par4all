THE LOOP BODY PRECONDITION DEPENDS ON:

 * the loop index appears in the loop bound expression
 * the index is integer
 * the index  is an integer analyzed scalar variable
 * the fix point operator used

Loopseq:

 * the loop index appears as lower bound
 * must enter

Loopseq2:

 * same as loopseq, but different index (j instead of i)

Invrw:

 * requires pattern matching fix point

THE LOOP INDEX EXIT CONDITION DEPENDS ON:

 * the enter, non-enter, maybe enter condition
 * the increment sign, known or not
 * the increment value, known or not
 * the increment value, 1, -1 or something else
 * the body effect on the values of loop bounds and loop increment

Loopexit 8:

 * enter==TRUE
 * increment==1

Loopexit 7:

 * enter==TRUE
 * increment==2

Loopexit 6:

 * enter==MAYBE
 * increment==2

Loopexit 5:

 * enter==MAYBE (=> convex hull of enter and non-enter)
 * increment==-1

Loopexit 4:

 * enter==TRUE
 * increment==1
 * induction variable j
 * constant k

Loopexit 3:

 * enter==FALSE (index==lower bound when leaving the loop)
 * increment==1
 * induction variable j (should have its initial value when leaving the loop)

Loopexit 2:

 * composite test with enter==FALSE, TRUE and MAYBE
 * increment==1 or -1
 * induction variable

Loopexit:

 * same as loopexit2.f, but with limit tests

Realindex:

 * make sure that a real index is ignored

Loopinit 3:

 * enter==FALSE

Loopinit 2:

 * same as loopinit3, but PIPS fails because the lower bound
   is not affine (but its value is known by PIPS!)
   enter==MAYBE. although it should be FALSE

Loopinit:

 * non-affine lower bound (of known value!)


Zerotrip:

 * combination of TRUE/FALSE/MAYBE enter

Modincr:

 * upper bound cannot be used because its value is modified by the loop body
 * no test about the increment!!!

Nullincr:

 * constant 0 increment

Nullcinr2:

 * increment == 0 because of preconditions

FIX POINT
---------

The following modules should be used: caveat.f, condinc.f, inc.f, pc.f
pcpugh.f, rw.f, rw2.f, tme.f (combinatorial explosion on preconditions),
tme2.f, tme3.f
