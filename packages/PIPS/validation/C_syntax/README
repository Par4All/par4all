Content of the validation suite

C99__function__     OK  check that implicit variable __function__ is defined

address_of01	    NOK C parser/prettyprinter error: 
		    	formal parameter names garbled

block_scope13	    NOK bug in controlizer

complex03.c	    NOK use symbol I, not recognized by PIPS preprocessor
		        moved to C_syntax_enhancement

decl24.c	    NOK either a C parser or a prettyprinter bug;
		        attribute const is moved from field display_data
	 		to the typedef itself; see decl50 and decl51
decl50.c	    OK  check the parsing and prettyprinting of the const 
		    	and volatile qualifier for pointer
decl51.c	    OK  check the parsing and prettyprinting of the const 
		    	qualifier for pointer and typedef
decl52.c	    NOK simplified version of decl24.c
decl53.c	    OK  a variety of const positions and combinations, 
		    	but not for fields
decl54.c	    OK  simplified version of decl52, struct with two int fields
		    	the first is const and not the second
decl55.c	    OK  simplified version of decl52, struct with one pointer
		    	field, const for pointer target

dereference.c	    NOK the source code is not easy to compile with gcc, even 
		    	using the options available in the tpips script
			Seems to work with tpips

duff_device01-03.c  OK  the switch and the while loop are properly destructured.
		        Pips is not able to recover the loop structure because of the
			many labels.
			No transformation seems to exist to build a prologue with labels
			and a loop body without labels.

extension02	    NOK	__attribute__ not parsed by PIPS preprocessor
		        Moved to C_syntax_enhancements

function_name_conflict01
		    NOK bug in parser for function rand

initialization06    NOK problem with summary transformer or precondition
		    	variable name conflict detected by gcc: error

initialization07    NOK C99 source code

parallel03	    NOK C code should be prettyprinted in Fortran
		    	Does not work anymore

pips		    NOK the tpips file expansion scheme does not work as
		    	might be expected by a casual user

rsp05		    NOK because of convex array regions
                        tpips to be simplified for C_syntax
			full script copied into Regions

struct11	    NOK not compatible with gcc
		    	fixed version core dumps the parser
			Since there is a warning, move to C_syntax_enhancements


Steps to prettyprint derived types as type declarations, "struct s {}"
or type references, "struct s"

struct02            OK
struct03            OK  internal type declaration to preserve
struct04            OK  same, simplified for debugging
struct05            OK  internal derived type use
struct06                not standard conformant
struct07                not standard conformant
struct08            OK  two unions with same name, but in different scopes
struct09            OK  conflict internal to a union declaration
struct10            OK  reference to a type declaration located in the c.u.
struct11                gcc warning, PIPS parser core dumps
                        union declaration within a function declaration
struct12            OK  for compilation unit, like struct05
                        PIPS parser core dumps on the function itself
struct13                not standard conformant
struct14            OK  test inside a cast
struct15            OK  test inside a sizeof
struct16            OK  easiest case, used to debug the SVN merge between SG and FI
struct17            OK  simple tree recursive data structure
struct18            NOK like struct04, but within a function instead of a compilation unit
struct19            OK  same as struct04, but with two struct nested
struct20            OK  simple list recursive data structure
struct21            OK  struct declared in a cast
struct22            OK  make sure simple cases are handled in a simple usual way

enum06              OK  reference to an enum in a declaration
enum07              OK  same as above + definition of an enum within a declaration
enum08              OK  enum declaration and reference nested within a struct
enum09              OK  enum declaration and reference nested within a union
enum10              OK  simplified version of enum09, used for debugging
enum11              OK  deeper nesting

generate07.c        NOK use a local type to type an external function (stupid but legal)
generate13.c        NOK same as generate07.c, but simplified to expose the issue

Note FI: I cannot deal with non-standard conformant C code because
PIPS does not generate an error log file
