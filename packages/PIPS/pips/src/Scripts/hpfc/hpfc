	$script is the HPF Compiler driver in front of pips.

	usage: $script [-hvdqt] [-o name] [-D cpp-macros]
	       function [options] [arguments]
	  OPTIONS:
	    -h: this help
	    -v: verbose
	    -d: demo (default)
	    -q: quiet
	    -t: timings
	    -T: time pips
	    -o name: name for the generated file (forwarded to compiler)
	    -D macro: additionnal cpp macros
	    -E var=val: additional environment variables

	  typical example: "hpfc -D NPES=4 -D SIZE=1000 -o adi adi2d.F"
	  to generate an "adi.hpfc" directory with everything in it...

	  also some function among (3 significant characters):
	  COMPILATION:
	    i|interactive: (thanks to GNU readline library) (\,cd)
	    c|compile: compile
	    m|make: compile and link
	    r|run: run
	    f|full: compile + make (shorthand for demos)
	    d|delete: delete hpfc directory
	    q|quit: does nothing
	  DEBUG:
	    D|debug: compile with debug option
	    C|clean: clean directories (pips and hpfc)
	    F|filter: show filter result
	  MISC:
	    !|sh: (sh) shell escape
	    p|pvm: pvm control
	    h|help: gives this help (but nothing more:-)
	    validate: used by the validation...

	END

# The default is demo (stderr silent, no warnings) because it does not
# look nice to make some "hpfc -q ..." and to have to explain that it
# is for demonstration purposes, in order to hide the generated warnings:-)
# I was kind enough to generate these (many) warnings, as a reminder of
# the (many) weaknesses of this prototype compiler.
