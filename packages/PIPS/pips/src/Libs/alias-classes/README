Goal of the library

Compute points-to information for each statement, that is a relation
between pointers or set of pointers and memory locations.

Organization of the library

  passes.c   	pass definitions, interface with pipsmake and pipsdbm

  statement.c	recursive statement analysis

  expression.c	recursive expression analysis

  sinks.c	given a points-to in, compute the set of memory locations
                possibly associated with a lhs expression

alias_classes.c
alias_lists.c
alias_pairs.c

  constant-path-utils.c: to be reengineered/checked/read... Assumes
  that sets of arcs are used as representation of the points-to graph

  points_to_analysis_general_algorithm.c : initial algorithm, build
  incrementaly so as to have results quickly and to explore the
  problems; it is re-used by copy to build the new version so as to
  keep two possible versions; the function names are changed from
  points_to_xxxx to xxx_points_to_yyy in order to avoid all conflict
  names

  points_to_init_analysis.c

  points_to_interprocedural_analysis.c

  points_to_prettyprint.c

  points_to_set.c	basic operation on points-to sets (~utils.c)

  prettyprint.c:

sav_alias_classes.c
sav_alias_lists.c

  emami.c: functions developed to implement Emami's algorithm
  assignment.c	analysis of assignment (statement or expression?)
