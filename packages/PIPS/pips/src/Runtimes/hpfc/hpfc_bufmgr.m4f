! First routines to fake the pack/unpack of data.
! The issue is to allow quite simply to measure the different
! overheads in the enumaration/packing/message stuff.
! Counts the number of calls, say for some statistics.
! The the routines for doing the job...
!
! ??? the routines are used for I/O communication with the reception
! already performed, hence the use of a global BUFFER ID...
