% These newgen data structure are used to propagate interprocedural alias
% information. When a formal parameter is associated with a actual
% variable by a certain call path, we assign the section and the offset of
% the actual variable to the formal one. 

% Lower and upper offsets are kept to give more information to the alias
% check phase, but when the exact offset can be translated to the callee's
% frame, we only keep this exact one. 

% 13/06/2001 NN : as we can not use preconditions (because we may have an
% alias violation in the code, so computed precondition are not true), we
% need only offset, not lower or upper offset.

% Call-site ordering is used to localize the call in the caller function. 

% 13/11/2001 NN: offset is not enough to remove some useless checks
% (because the section is not unique, useless tests on varibales in the
% same common block although there is no intersection of storage sequence,
% or in the same SUB*DYNAMIC* section, for example). So lower and upper
% bounds of the offset are added in order to simplify some false
% tests. These bounds are integers, for scalar variable: lower = upper =
% offset, for array variable: lower = &A <= offset <= upper = &A +
% size_of_array(A)
