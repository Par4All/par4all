The data structures following are used for the construction of the graph
of dependence cone. They are construted by using the data structure
\verb+statement+ and \verb+effect+ that are defined in the data structure
\verb+ri.newgen+ , the general structures \verb+vertex+ and \verb+arc+
from the package {\em graph}, and the domain {\tt Ptsg} is imported by the
linear integer library of CRI.   

\domain{Import statement from "ri.newgen"}
{}
\domain{Import effect from "effects.newgen"}
{}
\domain{Import vertex from "graph.newgen"}
{}      
\domain{External Ptsg}

\domain{dcdg\_vertex\_label = statement:int}
{This domain is used for the contain of the vertex of the graph of
dependence cone.}

\domain{dcdg\_arc\_label = dc\_conflicts:dc\_conflict*}
{This domain is used for the contain of the arc of the graph of
dependence cone.}

\domain{dc\_conflict = source:effect x sink:effect x dcsg: Ptsg}
{This domain contain the informations of two vertexs of the conflict and
dependence representation in generating system.}
