% These newgen data structure are used to propagate interprocedural points_to
% information. A points_to relation involved two entities :source and
% sink and an approximation of their relation.  
 


 
The domains points-to indicates that an abstract memory location
called {\em source} points to another abstract memory location called
{\em sink}. The arc between the two locations may either always exist,
and the approximation is EXACT, or possibly exist, and the
approximation is MAY. The abstract memory locations may contain
program variables or PIPS entities in their subscript expressions, and
their values are constrained by the {\em descriptor}.

\domain{points\_to = source:cell x sink:cell x approximation x descriptor}
{}
Note: the domains {\em approximation} and {\em descriptor} are
documented in ri.tex.

% \domain{access = referencing:points\_to\_path + addressing:points\_to\_path + dereferencing:points\_to\_path}{}
%\domain{points\_to\_path = reference}{}
%\domain{points\_to\_graph = arcs:points\_to*}{}

The points-to information is a list of points-to relations:
\domain{points\_to\_list = list : points\_to*}
{}

This domain is used to associate its points-to information to each statement:
\domain{statement\_points\_to = persistant statement -> points\_to\_list}
{}
