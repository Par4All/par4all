\section*{Introduction}

This report present the data structures used to attach
informations to some word of text, mainly to use in the hypertext Emacs
interface.

\domain{import call from "ri.newgen"}
{}
\domain{import entity from "ri.newgen"}
{}
\domain{import loop from "ri.newgen"}
{}
\domain{import reference from "ri.newgen"}
{}

I need to store pointer object:
\domain{External void_star}

\section{Attachments}

Are only a list of {\tt attachment}s:

\domain{attachments = attachment*}
{}


\section{Attachment}

Here is what can be attached to a word:

\domain{attachment = attachee x begin:int x end:int}
{}

{\tt begin} is the position of the attachment begin in the output
file and {\tt end} the position of its end.

The various objects that can be attached:
\domain{attachee = statement_line_number:int + persistent reference + persistent call + persistent declaration:entity + type:string + persistent loop + persistent module_head:entity + complementary_sections:unit + complexities:unit + continuation_conditions:unit + cumulated_effects:unit + out_regions:unit + preconditions:unit + privatized_regions:unit + proper_effects:unit + proper_regions:unit + regions:unit + static_control:unit + transformers:unit + decoration:unit + comment:unit}
{}

Persistence is need because we do not want the RI to be broken when
the attachments are freed.



\section{The mapping used to attach various internal informations}

%Each attachment point to a word of the code:
%\domain{attachment_to_word = attachment->string}

Each word can have a list of attachments:
\domain{word_to_attachments = word_pointer:void_star->attachments}
{}
\verb|word_pointer| is an {\tt int} instead of a {\tt string} since
the address must be used instead of the string content. So it needs a
cast...
