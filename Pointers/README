pointer14: arrays of pointers toward arrays of pointers

pointer_free

pointer_modif01: scalar pointers updated, intraprocedural; effects required to observe real impact; C code is wrong and the bug is detected by gcc

pointer_modif02: scalar pointers updated, interprocedural; effects required to observe real impact; C code is wrong and the bug is detected by gcc

pointer_reference04: uses a pointer reference, such as p[3]

problematique00: Fortran instrinsics used in C code

problematique: effects computation for heap-allocated arrays

operations is taken into account

statement01->statement07 : Basic cases of points-to, computing points-to relations for assignements of type <x = &i>, <x = y>, <x = &a[]> where x is of type pointer or double pointer.

statement01_dec: C code is wrong, bug found by gcc

static01: implicit initialization of static scalar pointer to NULL (C Standard)

struct00->struct04 : To illustrate fields of C stryct type which are pointers.

struct10: result not checked carefully

struct13:

struct19: initialization of a struct containing pointers

struct21.c: excerpt from struct13.c, subscript and struct assignment

For compatibility with Effects validation:
------------------------------------------

call04

For reengineering of the points-to analysis
-------------------------------------------

assignment01, 02, 03, 04: check handling of basic scalar pointer assignment (FI)

test01, 02, 03, 04: check handling of test statements (FI)

decl06: check generation of nowhere in a pointer declaration

pointerxy: copied from Rice

-------------new validation for points-to analysis------------- 

every test case added is either a bug to fixe either an enhancement of
the points-to analysis, please add a comment about the bug when you
add a test case.

bc_inter01: est-ce que ca marche en intraprocedural?
bc_inter02: idem
bc_inter03: idem
bc_inter04: ou est l'interprocedural

beatrice01: problemes? objectifs?
