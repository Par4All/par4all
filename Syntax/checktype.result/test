      PROGRAM CHECKTYPE

C     Goal: see if we know how to type check MAX, MAX0, AMAX1, DMAX1, AMAX0 and MAX1

      DOUBLE PRECISION X, Y, Z

      I = MAX0(I, J)                                                    0001

C     This one is wrong
      I = MAX0(I, J, 1.)                                                0002
