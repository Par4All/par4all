Select some options to deal with the C Language:
Parse as C:
Prettyprint the source as C, of course
Do not display original number lines as comment:
If possible, transform simple for-loops into do-loop a la Fortran, simpler to analyze:
Select the most precise analyses:
Compute the intraprocedural preconditions at the same time as
transformers and use them to improve the accuracy of expression
and statement transformers:
Try to restructure the code for more precision:
Check the proper effects
void for02(int n)
{
   int j;
   float x[100];
   float t, delta_t, t_max;
//             <may be read   >: delta_t
//             <    is read   >: t t_max
//             <    is written>: t

   for (t = 0.0;t<t_max;t += delta_t)
//             <    is written>: j
      for(j = 0; j <= 99; j += 1)
//             <    is read   >: j
//             <    is written>: x[j]
         x[j] = 0.;
