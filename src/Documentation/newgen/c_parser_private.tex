\section{Introduction}

The C parser context is used to store the information such as 
the scope, type and storage of the current entity, given by the decl\_spec\_list, 
which are used later by declarator to create the entity. 

\domain{import entity from "ri.newgen"}

\domain{import type from "ri.newgen"}

\domain{import storage from "ri.newgen"}

\domain{import qualifier from "ri.newgen"}

\domain{c\_parser\_context = scope:string x type:type x storage:storage x qualifiers:qualifier* x typedef:bool x static:bool}
