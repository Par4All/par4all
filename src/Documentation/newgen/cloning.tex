\section*{New type used for cloning}

This document defines and describes the data structure used to pass parameters to the \lstinline|clone_statement| function.
It consist of three fields given by the user:
\begin{itemize}
\item \lstinline|previous_module| is the entity of the module from which the cloned statement comes
\item \lstinline|new_module| is the entity of the module to which the cloned statement will be added. It can be the same as \lstinline|previous_module|
\item \lstinline|labels| is the label mapping between old labels and new labels. If the old statement has two entities with the same label (like the statement and a loop inside the statement), then the new entity must also have those two entities with the same label.
\item \lstinline|new_module_statement| is the root statement of \lstinline|new_module|
\end{itemize}

\domain{import entity from "ri.newgen"}
{}
\domain{import statement from "ri.newgen"}
{}

\domain{clone_context = previous_module:entity x new_module:entity x labels:entity* x persistent new_module_statement:statement}
{}
\end{document}
