<a name="introduction"><h2>Objectives</h2></a>

The goal of the <b>PIPS</b> project is to develop a free, open and
extensible workbench for automatically analyzing and transforming
scientific and signal processing applications. The <b>PIPS</b> workbench
is especially relevant for people interested in whole program compilation,
reverse-engineering, program verification, source-to-source program
optimization and parallelization. Its interprocedural analyses help with
program understanding and with checking legality and impact of automatic
program transformations. These transformations are used to reduce the
execution cost and latency, as well as the optimization cost itself.

<p>

Techniques developed for <b>PIPS</b> can be re-used for signal processing
code written in C, because pointers, data structures and dynamic
allocation are not used much, and for Java code optimization because array
boundary checking must be minimized conservatively.

<p>

<b>PIPS</b> is a free open workbench which has been used as support to develop
new analyses or program transformations by several teams from CEA-DAM,
Southampton University, SRU and ENS Cachan. These new developments benefit
at no cost from the general infrastructure and from already available
analyses and transformations. <b>PIPS</b> has also been used to develop a
HPF prototype compiler and to study optimizations for HPF.

<p>

<b>PIPS</b> is not primarily designed to support compiler back-end
research like <b>SUIF</b> but is much better as a Fortran source-to-source
tool because the data types (e.g. complex) the code structures, the
comments and, to some extent, the initial statement numbers are preserved.

<a name="Examples"><h2>Examples</h2></a>

<p>

<b>PIPS</b> was initially designed as an automatic parallelizer for
scientific programs. It takes as input Fortran 77 codes and emphasizes
<b>interprocedural</b> techniques for program analyses. <b>PIPS</b> specific
interprocedural analyses are precondition and <a
href="regions.html">array region</a> computations. <b>PIPS</b> automatically
computes affine preconditions for integer scalar variables which are much
more powerful than standard constant propagation or forward substitution
as shown below:

<p>


<TABLE BORDER=2 CELLSPACING=4 CELLPADDING=10 COLS=1  BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" NOSAVE >
<TR>
<TD>
<pre>
   I = 1
      N = 10 
      J = 3

C  P(I,J,N) {I==1, J==3, N==10}

      DO WHILE (I.LT.N)

C  P(I,J,N) {N==10, I<=9, 5<=2I+J, J<=3}

         PRINT *, I
         IF (T(I).GT.0.) THEN 
            J = J-2 
         ENDIF

         I = I+1

      ENDDO

C  P(I,J,N) {N==10, I==10, 5<=2I+J, J<=3}

      PRINT *, I, J
</pre>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<p>

<b>PIPS</b> also computes several kinds of polyhedral <b>array regions</b> (READ,
WRITE, IN and OUT) which are used for array and partial array
interprocedural <b>privatization</b> as well as for interprocedural
parallelization. Here, for instance, array <code>TI</code> is
automatically privatized in spite of its initialization thru the call to
<code>PVNMUT</code>:

<p>
<TABLE BORDER=2 CELLSPACING=4 CELLPADDING=10 COLS=1  BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" NOSAVE >
<TR>
<TD>
<pre>
!$OMP PARALLEL DO PRIVATE(J)
      DO K = K1, K2

!$OMP    PARALLEL DO PRIVATE(TI(1:3))
         DO J = J1, JA

            CALL PVNMUT(TI)
            T(J,K,NN) = S*TI(1)
            T(J,K,NN+1) = S*TI(2)
            T(J,K,NN+2) = S*TI(3)
         ENDDO
      ENDDO
</pre>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<p>

As mentioned above, <b>PIPS</b> can also be used as a reverse engineering
tool. Region analyses provide useful summaries of procedure effects, while
precondition-based <b>partial evaluation</b>  and <b>dead-code elimination</b> reduce
code size. <b>Cloning</b> has also be used successfully to split a routine
implementing several functionalities into a set of routines implementing
each exactly one functionality. Automatic <b>cleaning of declarations</b> is
useful when commons are over-declared thru include statements.

<a name="analyses-and-transformations"><h2>Analyses and Transformations</h2></a>

<p>

All analyses and transformations are listed in the documentation of the <a
href="pipsmake-rc/pipsmake-rc.html"><em>PIPS API</em></a> and of PIPS
interfaces. Static analyses compute call graphs, memory effects, use-def
chains, dependence graphs, interprocedural checks, transformers,
preconditions, continuation conditions, complexity estimation, reduction
detection, array regions (read, write, in and out, may or exact), aliases
and complementary sections. The results of analyses can be displayed with
the source code, with the call graph or with an elapsed interprocedural
control flow graph, as texts or as graphs. The dependence graphs can also
be displayed either as texts or graphs.

<p>

Several parallelization algorithms are available, including Allen&Kennedy,
as well as automatic code distribution, including a prototype HPF
compiler, <b>hpfc</b>. Different views of the parallel outputs are
available: HPF, OpenMP, Fortran90, Cray Fortran. Furthermore, the
polyhedral method of Pr. Feautrier also is implemented.

<p>

Program transformations include loop distribution, scalar and
array privatization, atomizers (reduction of a statements to a three-address
form), loop unrolling (partial and full), strip-mining, loop interchange,
partial evaluation, dead-code elimination, use-def elimination, control
restructuring, loop normalization, declaration
cleaning, cloning, forward substitution and expression optimizations.

<a name="workbench"><h2>Workbench</h2></a>

<p>

<b>PIPS</b> is based on linear algebra techniques for analyses, e.g.
dependence testing, as well as for code generation, e.g. loop interchange
or tiling.

<p>

Analyses and transformations are driven by a make system, <a
href="pipsmake.html"><em>(pipsmake)</em></a> which enforces consistency
across analyses and modules, and results are stored for future
interprocedural use in a database by a resource manager
<em>(pipsdbm)</em>. The workbench is made of phases that are called on
demand to perform the analyses or transformations required by the user.
Thus interprocedural requests are very easy to formulate: only the final
in demand result must be specified.

<center>
<IMG SRC=images/poster_aggrandi.gif><br>
<b>PIPS Overall Structure (Note: OpenMP and MPI outputs are now available)</b>
</center>

<p>

<b>PIPS</b> is built on top of two other tools. The first one is <a
href="Newgen/newgen_manual/newgen_manual.html"><em>Newgen</em></a> which
manages data structures a la <em>IDL</em>. It provides basic
manipulation functions for data structures described in a declaration
file. It supports persistent data and type hierarchies. An introductory
<a href="Newgen/newgen_paper/newgen_paper.html">paper (in English) </a> and a
<a href="Newgen/tutoriel_newgen/tutoriel_newgen.html">tutorial (in French)</a>
are available.

<p>

All <b>PIPS</b> data-types are based on <em>Newgen</em>. A description
of PIPS internal representation is available in a <a
href="ri/ri.html">technical report</a>. The mapping of Fortran onto the
PIPS internal representation is described in Technical Report <a
href="dret105/dret105.html">TR E/105</a>, Section 2.

<p>

The second tool is the <em>Linear C3</em> library which handles vectors,
matrices, linear constraints and structures based on these such as
polyhedra. The algorithms used are designed for integer and/or
rational coefficients. This library is extensively used for analyses
such as dependence test, precondition and region computation, and for
transformations, such as tiling, and for code generation, such as send
and receive code in HPF compilation. The <em>Linear C3</em> library is a
joint project with IRISA and PRISM laboratories, partially funded by
CNRS. IRISA contributed an implementation of Chernikova algorithm and
PRISM a C implementation of PIP (Parametric Integer Programming).

New phases have been developed for distributed-memory machines, both in
house (WP65 and HPFC projects) and outside.

<a name="user-interfaces"><h2>User Interfaces</h2></a>

<p>

Five user interfaces are available: a Shell interface <em>(Pips)</em>, a
line interface (<a href="tpips-user-manual.html"><em>Tpips user
manual</em></a> and <a href="tpips.html"><em>tpips man</em>)</a> and three
window-based interfaces. The three X-window interfaces <em>Wpips,
Epips</em> and <em> Jpips</em> to the workbench are the best suited for
new users (see the <a href="wpips.html"><em>wpips man</em></a> and <a
href="wpips-epips-user-manual/wpips-epips-user-manual.html"><em>WPips and

<a name="History"><h2>History</h2></a>

<p>

<b>PIPS</b> has been developed at <a href="/index-english.html">CRI</a>
since 1988, thru several research projects funded by the French DoD
(DRET), the French NSF (CNRS) and the European Union (ESPRIT
programs). The initial design was made by R&eacute;mi TRIOLET,
Fran&ccedil;ois IRIGOIN and Pierre JOUVELOT. This initial design has
proved good enough since then and has not required any major change. The
overview paper presented at <a href="Papers/ics91/ics91.html">ICS'91</a> still
is up-to-date, although major functionalities have been added since.

<p>

The current research objectives are:
<P>
<ul>
  <li>expression optimization for superscalar and VLIW architectures (<a
href="http://www.cri.ensmp.fr/~zory">Julien Zory</a>)

  <li>analysis refinement to support automatic computation of

  <li>compilation of signal processing specifications (<a
href="http://www.cri.ensmp.fr/~ancourt">Corinne Ancourt</a>)
</ul>

These objectives were defined with our industrial partners (CEA, EDF,
SAGEM, Thomson-CSF).


<a name="ExternalCollaboration"><h2>External Collaboration</h2></a>

A team at CEA, lead by
Benoit de Dinechin, contributed several phases which implement
techniques developed by Paul Feautrier (PRISM) for TMC CM-5 and Cray
T-3D machines, as well as extensions of these techniques (see <a
href="poly_meth.html">Polyhedric method</a>). These external phases were
easily blended within <b>PIPS</b> thanks to NewGen, which constraints the
number of data structures used by programmers and provide a general
framework for low-level classes (list, hash-table,...), and thanks to
<em>pipsmake</em> which hides the intra- and inter-procedural chaining
of analyses and transformations from the programmer as well as from the
user.

<a name="Availability"><h2>Availability</h2></a>

<p>

Ten years after its inception, <b>PIPS</b> as a workbench is still alive
and well. <b>PIPS</b> provides a robust infrastructure for new experiments in
compilation, program analysis, optimization, transformation and
parallelization. The <b>PIPS</b> developer environment is described in a <a
href="developer_guide/developer_guide.html">technical report</a> but it also is possible
to develop new phases on top of but <em>outside</em> of <b>PIPS</b> since all
(in fact, most...) <b>PIPS</b> data structures can be reloaded using Newgen
primitives from C or Lisp programs.

<p>

<b>PIPS</b> is written in C and developed under SUNOS 4.1.4. <b>PIPS</b>
can also be used under SOLARIS 2.5.1 and Solaris 2.6, under LINUX, under
AIX and Digital UNIX. Two versions are available: Integer values are
represented either by 32-bit or by 64-bit words. The source code is
available on request and executables are
