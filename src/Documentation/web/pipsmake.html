<H2><A NAME="INTRO">1) Introduction</A></H2>

<P>From a theorectical point of view, the object types and functions
avalaible in <A HREF="http://www.cri.ensmp.fr/~pips">PIPS</A> define an
heterogenous algebra with contructors (e.g. parser), extarctors
(e.g. prettyprinter) and operators (e.g. loop unrolling). Very few
combinations of functions make sense, but many functions and object
types are available. This abundance is confusing for casual and
experienced users and is was deemed necessary to assist them by
providing default computation rules and automatic consistency
management.
</P>

<P>The <i>Pipsmake</i> library - not so far from the Unix make utility
- is intended for interprocedural use. The objects it manages are
resources, stored in memory or/and on disk.  The phases are described
by generic rules, which use and produce resources.
</P>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="DESCRIP">2) Internal description</A></H2>

<H3>2.1) Different kinds of rules</H3>

<P>The <i>pipsmake.rc</i> file contains rules, which define the
behaviour of the library. <A HREF="http://www.cri.ensmp.fr/~pips"
>PIPS</A> phases have been divided in two types:
<br>

<UL>
	<LI><b>Analyses</b>, generating one or more resources.<br>
	These phases cannot require resources they produce. e.g. parser,
dependance graph, parallel views ...
	<LI><b>Transformations</b>, modifying one or more existing
resources.<br>
	These phases update resources - all produced resources
are required. e.g. loop unrolling, dead code elimination ...
</UL>

</P>

<P>
Let's see an example of analyses:
<pre>
parser                 &gt MODULE.parsed_code
                       &gt MODULE.callees
    &lt PROGRAM.entities
    &lt MODULE.source_file

hpfc_close             &gt PROGRAM.hpfc_commons
    ! SELECT.hpfc_parser
    ! ALL.hpfc_directives
    # PROGRAM.entities
    # PROGRAM.hpfc_status
    &lt MAIN.hpfc_host
</pre>

The first rule is the parser phase. To parse a module, you need the
resources describing the entities of the whole program and the source
file of the module to be up-to-date. Then you'll get the parsed code
of the module and its callees (i.e. the list of the functions it
calls).
<br>

The second rule - much more complex - is the last one of the HPF
compiler. It will create the resource <tt>hpfc_commons</tt> for the
program. It requires the resource <tt>hpfc_host</tt> of the main
function and it will destroy the resources <tt>entities</tt> and
<tt>hpfc_status</tt>. Morover it will first run the transformation
called <tt>hpfc_directives</tt>. Also it requires the code to be parsed
by <tt>hpfc_parser</tt> instead of the usual parser.

</P>

<P>
Now take a look at some transformations:
<pre>
unroll                 &gt MODULE.code
    &lt PROGRAM.entities
    &lt MODULE.code

hpfc_filter            &gt MODULE.source_file
    &lt MODULE.source_file

hpfc_directives        &gt MODULE.code
                       &gt PROGRAM.hpfc_status
    &lt PROGRAM.entities
    &lt PROGRAM.hpfc_status
    &lt MODULE.code
</pre>

The first transformation describes the loop unrolling phase. It needs
the entities of the program and it will update the code of the module.
<br>

The second phase is a source file filter made for the HPF compiler. So
it will update the source file of the desired module.
<br>

The last example - used by the rule <tt>hpfc_close</tt> - is a
transformation updating the <tt>code</tt> and the
<tt>hpfc_status</tt>.

</P>

<P>

Let's see another excerpt of the configuration file, which emphasizes
the inter-procedural capabilities of <i>Pipsmake</i>:

<pre>
proper_effects         &gt MODULE.proper_effects 
    &lt PROGRAM.entities
    &lt MODULE.code
    &lt CALLEES.summary_effects

cumulated_effects      &gt MODULE.cumulated_effects
    &lt PROGRAM.entities 
    &lt MODULE.code 
    &lt MODULE.proper_effects

summary_effects        &gt MODULE.summary_effects
    &lt PROGRAM.entities
    &lt MODULE.code 
    &lt MODULE.cumulated_effects
</pre>

Here, for instance, the phase <tt>cumulated_effects</tt> computes the
accumulated effects (such as a read on a given variable, called
<b>entity</b> in <A HREF="http://www.cri.ensmp.fr/~pips">PIPS</A>) of all
the statements of a <b>MODULE</b>. It needs the definition of all the
entities of the <b>PROGRAM</b> - recall that <A
HREF="http://www.cri.ensmp.fr/~pips">PIPS</A> is interprocedural-, the
code of the module and its proper effects, i.e. the effects of the
atomic subroutine calls.

This architecture is incremental, since data structures are computed
only when needed by some phase, and flexible, since each phase does
not have to worry about the others and only request resources at its
outset. This organization permits the interprocedurality to be almost
transparent to the programmer of a given phase since he can ignore how
resources are computed. Each necessary resource is requested from
<i>Pipsdbm</i> and the appropriate function has previously been
automatically activated by <i>Pipsmake</i>, if the rules are
correct. This allows for easy implementations of both top-down and
bottom-up algorithms on the call graph of a program. Note however that
it relies heavily upon the non recursivity of Fortran77. It also
provides the database structure necessary to combine interprocedural
analysis and the speed necessary for interactivity: objects are
computed only when there is a need to and when they are not already
available and up-to-date.
</P>

<h3>2.2) Complete rule format</h3>

<P>

Frist a rule has a name ;=), and a list of constraints concerning its
appliance which are:

<UL>
	<LI><b>required resources (&lt)</b><br>
	These resources need to be proved up to date before applying the rule
	<LI><b>output resources (&gt)</b><br>
	These resources will be produced by this rule
	<LI><b>modified resources (#)</b><br>
	These resources are going to be destroyed (they are needed only if
they are in the	required_resources list)
	<LI><b>unalterated resources (=)</b><br>
	These resources will not be altered by the appliance of the rule
unless rule dependancies should state it (they will be touched)
	<LI><b>transformation rules to be applied before (!)</b><br>
	These are <b>rule names</b> corresponding to transformations which
have to be run before
</UL>

</P>

<P>

Rules are generic and will be instanciated for a module at
runtime. For a given module name, resources <b>owner</b> may be:
<br>

<UL>
<LI><b>PROGRAM</b>: the complete program (i.e. all modules in the source files)
<LI><b>MODULE</b>: the module itself
<LI><b>MAIN</b>: the main module (if any)
<LI><b>ALL</b>: all the modules
<LI><b>CALLERS</b>: the set of calling modules (of the current one)
<LI><b>CALLEES</b>: the set of called modules (by the current one)
<LI><b>SELECT</b>: allows to force a selection, if several rules may produce
  a same resource. does only make sense with the bang syntax.
</UL>

A resource is referenced by both its - lowercase- <b>name</b> and its -
uppercase - <b>owner</b> with the following syntax:
<br>

<pre>
    OWNER.name
</pre>

Resources with a generic owner are called <b>virtual
resources</b>. When instanciated they are called <b>real
resources</b>.

</P>

<P>

You may want to see the <A HREF="pipsmake-rc/pipsmake-rc.html">complete
description of the rules</A> for PIPS. Note that a consistent subset of
these rules could be defined to derive automatically a tool with a
subset of PIPS capabilities. For instance, PIPS could be restricted to
program analyses or to parallelization for shared-memory machines.

</P>
<h3>2.3) Up to date resources</h3>

<P>

For each resource, at least one analyse rule producing it should
exist. If many rules could be used to produce a resource, then the
first one - in the file - is used. In order to specify another rule,
<A HREF="#API">a rule activation process</A> is present.

</P>

<P>

According to the rule activated for a given resource, one can say this
resource is up to date when:

<UL>
	<LI>the resource exists - in the database
	<LI>all the required resources (&lt) but the modified ones (#) are
up to date (recursively)
	<LI>the <b>logical dates</b> of the previous resources are less or equal
to the current resource one
</UL>

</P>

<P>

Resources logical dates have been introduced because of the lack of
precision of Unix files dates. It is a number, incremented by one for
each new phase launched by <i>pipsmake</i>. So that resources built by
the same rule will have the same logical date. For file resources Unix
dates are kept, too. It is then possible to determine whether such a
resource has been modified - e.g. edited.

</P>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="DBM">3) Resource management</A></H2>

<P>

A data base - created on NewGen - allow clear resources status
management. Some resources are unloadable, some can only be kept in
memory and others can be stored either in memory or on disk. This data
manager (<i>pipsdbm</I>) gives confort and security to the resources
manipulations. Called on demand, this library will give clean resource
status (e.g. date) or allow consistent resource modifications.

</P>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="API">4) A.P.I.</A></H2> 

The Application Programing Interface of this library consists of three
functions:
<br>

<UL>
	<LI><tt>make(resource name, owner name)</tt>: is going to build
the resources '<i>resource name</i>' for the set of modules described
by '<i>owner name</i>'.
	<LI><tt>apply(phase name, owner name)</tt>: will apply the phase
'<i>phase name</I>' to the set of modules described by '<i>owner
name</i>'.
	<LI><tt>activate(phase name)</tt>: will activate this rule for all
it produced resources. It is going do delete from the database all the
produced resources <b>recursively</b> (using activated rules only).
