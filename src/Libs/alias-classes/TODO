Points to improve in points-to analysis

No priority order.

7. EffectsWithPointsTo: the fully subscripted sources and sinks
require index substitution in EffectsWithPointsTo, or the parallelism
detection is lost; also it is not clear if you want to preserver x[j]
instead of *(x+j)....; see for instance call05.c. See also call14.c.

8. EffectsWithPointsTo: Also in call14 or call05, probably an
interprocedural translation issue in call08 for _x_3 in the callee and
y in the caller. Also, many returns are missing in the source codes of
EffectsWithPointsTo: they would be useful to debug the points-to
analysis

9. EffectsWithPointsTo/call09.c: duplicate effect on s.one. Same in call10.

10. EffectsWithPointsTo/call15.c: understand the "may be written",
probably due to NULL pointer initialization, but should have been
automatically eliminated by the dereferencement. In fact call15 does
not check its argument pi or q. Stricto sensu, it is really a may. But
if summary information is linked to a function that returns, the
information should be a must at the caller level... See also results
for struct22 and probably many other test cases.

11. EffectsWithPointsTo/chap2_exp4: why do we get a maybe effect on
*heap*? Because the heap lattice is not precise enough to distinguish
between exact heap references and abstract heap references. Add an
extra dimension to model the occurences? See below heap modeling (19).

12. EffectsWithPointsTo/dereferencing06: improved results thanks to a
better analysis of pointer arithmetics.

13. EffectsWithPointsTo/fpointer01: result is now less precise.

14. EffectsWithPointsTo/fulguro04: result modified to take into
account an implicit dimension.

15. EffectsWithPointsTo: differences from global02 to varargs04 to be
looked at.

18. dereferencing02: a variable, w, is used uninitialized and this is
not detected. And there is a bug for "double * z1=*q++".

19. Improve heap model. Add an extra first dimension to model the
different intraprocedural dynamic occurences of a malloc? See Point 11 too.

20. Pre-decrement and pre-increment are likely to be evaluated
twice. See the post case in
unary_intrinsic_call_to_points_to_sinks(). No test case yet I'm
afraid.

22. Handling of >, >=, <, <= in pointer conditions. No test case yet.

23. When iterating the analysis of a loop, the points-to graph are
accumulated when they should be merged. The accumulation does not
update the approximations. See Strict_typing.sub/linked_list01.c for
instance.

24. The consistency check does not check that arcs starting from a
vertex of out-degree strictly greater than 1 must be may arcs.

25. Strict_typing.sub/fabien03: bug detected by or in a type check.

27. In Strict_typing.sub/list02, in "main", the points-to obtained on
exit of the while loop is declared "unreachable". Same in list03.

32. statement01_dec: should we generate a NOWHERE rather than a bottom
graph? Should this be a property? Ot it should generate a pointer
towards an integer stub...  which would make dependence testing maybe
more difficult... unless you trust the programmer that integer pointer
values do not interact with any properly declared variable.

35. Heap model: malloc can return a NULL pointer. This is not the
usual case, but it should be controlled by a property...

38. pointer15: the indices for _t_1 are not properly located. The first subscript should be zero for the implicit dimension. [1][2] should be the second and third subscripts

39. If a stub is added to deal with casts, Rice/test03.c could be
parallelized by trusting the type of the pointer
"toto". EffectWithPointsTo should also be able to understand these
stubs of a new kind...

40. Rice/test03: when the points-to information is recomputed the
formal context should be cleaned up, unless it is explictly defined as
an input. Samething for the heap. Which means that this stubs should
be added to the declaration list of the module... Impact on symbol
table? See 41.

41. Rice/test03: the type of entities in the formal context should not
be changed once they have been allocated. Unless some code
transformation has indeed changed them. For instance, dependent types may be changed into constant types by "partial eval". See 40.

Next item will be 42.

----------------------------------------------------------

Done:

5. Connexion with effects_with_points_to: improve the points-to precondition or use a more powerful function in effects_with_points_to()? Or both?

-> I have enriched the points-to information (not sure yet it is enough)

6. Be able to dereference constant pointers, a.k.a. arrays. See
Pointers/array03.c, function foo2. Build a smaller test case.

-> new test case array14.c

2. C subscript construct analysis: see fulguro04.c for instance and some others:

argv03:   char *p = (*argv)[1];
fulguro03
fulguro04:     (dat->array)[row]
Lv
pointer08:     t->tree_list[i] = (struct tree*) malloc(sizeof(struct tree));
pointer16:     t->tree_list[i] = (struct tree*) malloc(sizeof(struct tree));
ptr_to_array01:   (*p)[3] = &a;
pv_assign05:   s1.b[0] = &j; (?) several occurences
pv_assign06:   s2->b[0] = &i;
struct10:      a.p[i] = i;
struct13:      e.champ[i].p = malloc(10*sizeof(int));
               (e.champ)[i].p = malloc(10*sizeof(int));
struct21:      simplified version of struct13	       
struct_parall01: a.p[i] = i;


16. Mixed up indices, for instance in argv03. Also pointer15, struct09

-> seems now OK for argv03. FI: I do not know about the other cases.

1. Serious handling of conditions, starting with equality and
disequality; see list06.c (altough this piece of code looks dead
wrong...)

3. Convergence detection: current implementation no longer works as it used to

4. Add a new dimension to the graph expansion control: outgoing
degree, shown in one of the list functions, the freeing of a list (see
list05).

21. Conditional operator: arcs created in "in_t" or "in_t" do not
appear in "out". See conditional06.

-> fixed with a call to merge_points_to_graphs()

-> hopefully, approximations are taken a good care of

26. The consistency check does not check that the set is empty when
bottom is true.

29. offset_points_to_cell(): the type should be passed in order to
update the proper subscript. See dereferencing08.c

30. address_of01: the code is wrong, but gcc does not provide any
warning. Neither does PIPS, but it generates a wrong and meaningless
reference to i[1].

31. arithmetic11: type error. One too many [0] subscript... Core dumps.

37. call14: cast in actual argument not properly processed. We might
need new stubs to cope with this.

-> fixed in that case by tuning the reference according to the cast;
   namely, (int *) y is changed in &y[0];

34. Strict_typing.sub/malloc03: "pt++" is not properly interpreted
because the sink is not large enough.

-> either sources with this issue were modified and the necessary dimension declared or the their tpips were modified to avoid core dumping when a user error is encountered

33. cast must be exploited to avoid further bugs when pointer
arithmetic is used.

-> at least, partly implemented in simple cases

28. pv_local_var03: issue with declaration and assignment of array of
structs; the generated arcs do not seem added to the current "in"
points-to environment; it is not clear if index * should or not
susbsumes indices 0 and 1. The test case is not good because the rhs
struct are not initialized, hence only exact nowhere information is
propagated.

-> arcs due to local variables do not have to appear in the "in"
   points-to environment

17. Take care of casts. See for instance Strict_typing.sub/malloc03.c

-> a first cut

36. Condition with side effects in and_operator02 is not taken into account.

-> not really useful, I believe (FI), but apparently easy to implement.
