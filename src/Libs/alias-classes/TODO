Points to improve in points-to analysis

No priority order.

1. Serious handling of conditions, starting with equality and disequality; see list06.c (altough this piece of code looks dead wrong...)

3. Convergence detection: current implementation no longer works as it used to

4. Add a new dimension to the graph expansion control: outgoing degree, shown in one of the list functions, the freeing of a list (see list05).

7. EffectsWithPointsTo: the fully subscripted sources and sinks
require index substitution in EffectsWithPointsTo, or the parallelism
detection is lost; also it is not clear if you want to preserver x[j]
instead of *(x+j)....; see for instance call05.c. See also call14.c.

8. EffectsWithPointsTo: Also in call14 or call05, probably an
interprocedural translation issue in call08 for _x_3 in the callee and
y in the caller. Also, many returns are missing in the source codes of
EffectsWithPointsTo: they would be useful to debug the points-to
analysis

9. EffectsWithPointsTo/call09.c: duplicate effect on s.one. Same in call10.

10. EffectsWithPointsTo/call15.c: understand the "may be written",
probably due to NULL pointer initialization, but should have been
automatically eliminated by the dereferencement. In fact call15 does
not check its argument pi or q. Stricto sensu, it is really a may. But
if summary information is linked to a function that returns, the
information should be a must at the caller level...

11. EffectsWithPointsTo/chap2_exp4: why do we get a maybe effect on
*heap*? because the heap lattice is not precise enough to distinguish
between exact heap references and abstract heap references.

12. EffectsWithPointsTo/dereferencing06: improved results thanks to a
better analysis of pointer arithmetics.

13. EffectsWithPointsTo/fpointer01: result is now less precise.

14. EffectsWithPointsTo/fulguro04: result modified to take into
account an implicit dimension.

15. EffectsWithPointsTo: differences from global02 to varargs04 to be
looked at.

17. Take care of casts. See for instance Strict_typing.sub/malloc03.c

18. dereferencing02: a variable, w, is used uninitialized and this is
not detected.

Next item will be 19.

Done:

5. Connexion with effects_with_points_to: improve the points-to precondition or use a more powerful function in effects_with_points_to()? Or both?

-> I have enriched the points-to information (not sure yet it is enough)

6. Be able to dereference constant pointers, a.k.a. arrays. See
Pointers/array03.c, function foo2. Build a smaller test case.

-> new test case array14.c

2. C subscript construct analysis: see fulguro04.c for instance and some others:

argv03:   char *p = (*argv)[1];
fulguro03
fulguro04:     (dat->array)[row]
Lv
pointer08:     t->tree_list[i] = (struct tree*) malloc(sizeof(struct tree));
pointer16:     t->tree_list[i] = (struct tree*) malloc(sizeof(struct tree));
ptr_to_array01:   (*p)[3] = &a;
pv_assign05:   s1.b[0] = &j; (?) several occurences
pv_assign06:   s2->b[0] = &i;
struct10:      a.p[i] = i;
struct13:      e.champ[i].p = malloc(10*sizeof(int));
               (e.champ)[i].p = malloc(10*sizeof(int));
struct21:      simplified version of struct13	       
struct_parall01: a.p[i] = i;


16. Mixed up indices, for instance in argv03. Also pointer15, struct09

-> seems now OK for argv03. FI: I do not know about the other cases.
